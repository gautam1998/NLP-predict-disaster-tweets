# NLP-Predict-Disaster-Tweets
This code is based on the kaggle competition Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets . 
The aim of this competition is to predict a tweet as a disaster related tweet or not .

Project Overview

    Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitous of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they're observing in real-     time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programmatically monitoring tweets(i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies) but, it's not always clear whether a person's words are actually announcing a disaster.

    Take an example of a tweet 'On plus side LOOK AT THE SKY LAST NIGHT IT WAS ABLAZE'. The author of the tweet explicitly uses the word "ABLAZE" but means it metaphorically. This is clear to a human right away, especially with the visual aid but it's less clear to a machine.

    Kaggle¹ hosted this challenge on their platform and data set was created by the company figure-eight² originally shared on their 'Data For Everyone' website (https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/).
